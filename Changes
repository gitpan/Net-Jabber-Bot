Revision history for Net-Jabber-Bot

2.1.3
Tests were failing if people didn't have Config::Std installed which is only used for Author tests

2.1.2
Added warning message for legacy users initializing with message_callback or background_activity.

2.1.1 
Add proper meta data into makefile.pl
Cleanup debug messages. Used to be able to do them inline but moose subs don't call inside a string any more.

2.1.0 
MOOSE!!!

2.0.9
New subroutines (AddUser, RmUser, GetStatus, GetRoster) to track ??? 
IsConnected reports connect status now.
ReConnect now works as expected. Calls background each re-connect attempt.

2.0.8
Bot now resonds to iq requests for version info. Also added gtalk example into the manifest (forgot for 2.0.7)

2.0.7
Fix to get gtalk working, kindly provided by Yago Jesus. It's doing something really funky with setting the hostname to gmail.com.
Need to later review why we're doing this. maybe we're ignorning connect messages from the server?
Also added gtalk bot example courtesy of Yago
New subs: GetRoster, ChangeStatus

2.0.6
Test::Pod::Coverage not configured to skip tests if not avail. Corrected this.

2.0.5
Missed a test file mentioning IO::Prompt (t/03)

2.0.4
Removed some email addresses present.
Tidy up manifest
Referring to google project in POD now.
Inserted gtalk fixes so the module will work with them.
Funky eval issue with gtalk client commented out. We'll have to look at that later, but for now we don't need it at all

2.0.3
Creation of Mock Client to allow automation of testing without a server.
Also added Example script so someone can see how to use the module.

2.0.2
Added Log::Log4Perl as dependancy. This should be in everyone's CPAN so it shouldn't be a big deal that people need to install it even though it's not necessary for people to use the module...

2.0.1
Oops! Guess I need to make this module dependant on Net::Jabber if it's ever going to make test.

2.0.0
Move to 3 digit version (see pause.perl.org FAQ about starting with 2 digit version and going to 3)
internal callback maker created to reduce code.

1.2.1 Call back functions how call self funcion via anonymous subs.
Minor bug fixes and cleanup.

1.2.0 Re-enabled config test, plus fixed some docs. Versioning changes from here out to be 3 digit.
Bot will respond to different addressings per forum (all messages, jbot:, etc.)

1.1 Initial CPAN release - Basic tests built. Still more needed. Some of the limits are hard
coded. Arguably, these should be more in a child module, not the base class?

1.0 Initial pre-CPAN release -- Does basic stuff but no tests yet. not CPAN ready
