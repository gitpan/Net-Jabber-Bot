Revision history for Net-Jabber-Bot

1.2.0 Re-enabled config test, plus fixed some docs. Versioning changes from here out to be 3 digit. Bot will respond to different addressings per forum (all messages, jbot:, etc.)
1.1 Initial CPAN release - Basic tests built. Still more needed. Some of the limits are hard coded. Arguably, these should be more in a child module, not the base class? 
1.0 Initial pre-CPAN release -- Does basic stuff but no tests yet. not CPAN ready
